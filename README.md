# PythonWebScrapers
These three files are simple ways of getting stock data for various tickers at the end of the day. They were my first foray into web scraping and were written for a school project, but all the code is my own solution. 
## Methodology
For the Google and Yahoo Finance.py's, the methodology is the same, althought I had to look for different indicators. I used a simple regex equation to find the numbers I was looking for and save them to a text file. The Bloomberg.py simply accesses Bloombergs free public api and stores the requested data in JSON format. 
## Installation
These were originally made in IDLE but can be used in any other IDE.
## Libraries Used
Three python standard libraries were used in these projects, requests, JSON, and RE(regex). No extra installs necessary.
